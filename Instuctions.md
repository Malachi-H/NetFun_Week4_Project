## 1. Introduction 

This guide walks you through creating a simple HTTP server in Python. The server will: 

    Listen for incoming HTTP requests. 

    Process the request and determine the requested file. 

    Check if the file exists and serve it if available. 

    Respond with 404 Not Found if the file is missing. 

    Close the connection after sending the response. 

### Group Project Guidelines 

    This is a group project, and students should work in teams of three. 

    Each student will be assessed individually, so the final score for each member may vary. 

    The project is worth 5 points: 

    3.5 points for code demonstration. 

    1.5 points for answering questions. 

    The questions will be based on your demonstration and testing. 

    You will typically be asked 2-3 questions to assess your understanding of the project and concepts learned.
